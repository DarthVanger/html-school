  >> Last month I was off in Boston for the
  fourth annual World Wide Web Conference, and had the opportunity to talk to
  the inventor of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee. And I asked him a little bit about
  where are we going with this web stuff. And we have just a little bit
  of footage from Tim telling us where that's going to be. >> You haven't seen nothing yet. But you wait until people assume the web. When the web becomes something
  you can assume, when the web or the infrastructure is all laid down and
  we have an information space, then it will be time for the next revolution
  >> It's hard to imagine a, a greater evolution than what we've seen,
  I mean, I, I go to the smallest places, and
  everybody's putting up a web page. >> Right, but
  the web could only take place, the revol, the web revolution could only
  take place because the internet, which would be had been a quieter,
  smaller revolution, but that had been of the Internet itself quietly being deployed
  throughout the world had happened. Because the Internet was
  something people could assume, the Web revolution could take place. When the Web is something you can assume,
  then maybe a cultural revolution, and I say cultural revolution. We need cultural revolution perhaps or maybe we'll find ways of doing things
  better that we haven't imagined. >> Pretty neat, Rich. One of the things that I, I liked about
  it was he, he just said, we're going to, his idea was, the next step is
  something completely different, a cultural revolution as compared
  to just a little more technology. And he, Tim Berners-Lee being from Europe, I can sort of see how he
  can have that perspective
